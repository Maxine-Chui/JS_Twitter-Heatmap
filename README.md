### Timeline
* Day 1
    * Complete set up (Node and webpack)
    * Review JS and learn enough D3 to get an idea of how to get started
* Day 2
    * Learn Twitter API to fetch necessary data
    * Build the map and begin populating data
* Day 3
    * Have a functional screen with filters and data and user can interact with the model
* Day 4
    * Styling and finishing touches

### Bonus Features
* Showing top-trending and relevant news events relating to the tweet
* Users can filter by time (one week ago, 6 months ago, or a date range). Current idea is to only have the last 24 hrs of data
